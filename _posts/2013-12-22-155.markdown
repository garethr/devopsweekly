A great detailed post about logs. What they are, why they are important and how best to use them at scale. Lots in here, from distributed systems design, to data warehousing and ETL, to a good list of papers to read.

A presentation attempting to model devops, using lots of existing visualisations of what devops means and also looking at patterns that emerge from those models. Great stuff.

This weeks survey is the yearly Devops survey from PuppetLabs, Gene Kim and Jez Humble. 10 minutes of interesting questions (and a few prizes) and then a wait for the results.

Devops in large organisations always comes with interesting challenges. This post, with lots of concrete examples, talks through a devops journey inside a large bank. Focuses on the need for shared configuration management, and includes some mockups of automated change management tooling.

Ignoring the silly name part way through this is a good post about designers and how they fit into a more integrated, collaborative team. Includes data from GitHub to back up the point which is interesting.

A good list of ten non-functional requirements for development teams, focusing on good operations. While I think this is good I think the topic is much broader, maybe top 100 next time?

I always go round in circles when choosing a new language to learn so it’s always good when people write-up their decision and thinking. Here’s a pretty solid argument why learning Java makes lots of sense for systems people.

Tools

A very handy new Chef library, Chef Sugar provides a number of useful helpers all in one place to simplify your Chef recipes. So things like windows? and ubuntu_before_lucid? and installed_at_version? to name a few.

Vector is a predictive scaling tool for Amazon’s auto-scaling groups. What that means is it looks at historical data to guess whether you’re autoscaling group will trigger soon and triggers it early to avoid the rush. Read the full example in the README to get a clearer picture.

MIDAS is a Python framework for developing a Mac Intrusion Detection Analysis System. It provides a small library, along with tools for writing checks and doing local analysis. Early days but interesting to see more automation in this domain.
