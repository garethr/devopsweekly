## Issue 121 - 28th April

_ChefConf was last week so lots of good conference links this week. The keynote videos are already online too at http://www.youtube.com/user/Opscode. So no excuses for missing out on some of the content._

=======

Entertaining configuration management and Chef issues. Why are packages good? Why should I test anything? Why not just drop in that bash script and run it? Good examples and tips on how to avoid them.

Not sure if this was new but I saw it via some ChefConf discussions. If you plan on using Chef you need to know at least a little Ruby. This page from the Chef documentation tries to identify just enough Ruby to at least get you started.

Presentation from ChefConf on managing resources and providers. It's a nice short walk though of the different approaches to cookbook design, stepping through three generations of the same cookbook, showing the pitfalls along the way.

Posts defining devops are still useful, especially as so many people have yet to come across the term at all. This one talks from recent experience working with IT organisations and has some nice examples and focuses on the mutual understanding needed to move quickly.
