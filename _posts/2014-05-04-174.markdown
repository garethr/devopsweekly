## Issue 174 - 4th May

_The sheer variety of interesting content under the devops banner is still what keeps me putting together this email every week. Case in point, this week I found a devops themed card game. All that’s missing is a Devops Weekly card._

The link title says it all. Devops against humanity. If you’re already familiar with the card game you’ll know what this is already. I can see this getting an open space slot at the next Devopsdays event.

Hopefully just in time for more people to get involved with this. ReadOps is an online book group all about technical operations. The first book to read for May is In Search of Certainty, with a the first discussion group set for the 10th of May.

The next post stresses the importance of environment portability and scalability, from development to production and everything in between. Some nice diagrams and ideas around a (Groovy) DSL for describing environment characteristics.

If you’re using Jenkins but configuring it via the web interface then Jenkins Job Builder is for you. But once you start you want to automate everything, which means writing Jenkins Job Builder plugins. This post covers how.

A nice talk introducing monitoring with metrics and Graphite, talking about what to monitor, what to ignore, the importance of percentiles, tips for scaling and lots of useful links.

Site Reliability Engineering is a good description of some technical operations roles and the following site is the unofficial blog for Google Site Reliability Engineering. It’s just getting started, with a detailed interview about what being an SRE is all about.

A nice post with the view that while devops is of interest to both startup and large enterprises, what it looks like might well be different because the challenges are different. Obvious when you think about it but worth stating anyway.

Tools

I’ve been starting to think about more dynamic load balancing recently and projects like Vulcand are very interesting. It combining a custom HTTP Proxy with configuration stored in Etcd, with the configuration updating automatically as the config changes.

A very simple but powerful deployment user interface based around Git and a simple YAML configuration file.

Kamon is a nice, opinionated, distribution of tools designed to make collecting metrics from scala applications easier. It uses Graphite or New Relic as the backend and provides modules for monitoring actors, tracing application requests and logging.
