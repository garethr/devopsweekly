## Issue 134 - 28th July

_A few good talks about deployment this week, as well as a scattering of security discussion, a deep dive into some hardware and more details about PuppetConf. Speaking of PuppetConf, I’m going to be in San Francisco for the week of the conference (from 20th August) if any readers want to meet-up or suggest things I should go along to._

Really good presentation deck about how to get deployment right. Focuses on the evolution of an automated development capability and the supporting processes rather than specific tools. Essential reading.

A nice guide to using pkgr, a nifty too which packages up a Ruby on Rails application as a deb package. A good example of a high level opinionated tool.

Blog post, along with lots of code examples, of how to automate immutable servers using Packer. Uses puppet as provisioning tool rather than to manage/audit configuration drift but some interesting ideas.

A nice introduction to the Infrastructure as Code concept. Takes a very first principles approach, explaining privatives and idempotency and only then introducing some of the better known tools.

If you’re using many small open source projects hopefully you’re often contributing small patches back upstream. That probably means using Git and remembering how to keep your branch up-to-date. Here’s the clearest walkthrough I’ve seen.

Jobs
====

Mandiant has multiple openings for Mid to Senior Operations Engineers to support the development and deployment of a next generation security analytics platform. The ideal candidate would be a Linux/Python generalist with experience building, scaling, and monitoring data-intensive AWS-based applications. Candidates must have extensive automation and configuration management experience with a preferred specialization in either MongoDB, MySQL, Sphinx, Node.js or a continuous build system such as Jenkins. Operations and Engineering teams are distributed across the US, so candidates may be remote or work from a Mandiant office in the US.
