## Issue 183 - 6th July

_Two of the featured tools this week (Puppet Explorer and Tesera) reminded me just how far we’ve come in only a few years with really nice looking user interfaces for operations tools. The long running thread on the Jenkins mailing list about user interfaces improvements also suggests we’re starting to demand tools that prioritise design and user experience as well as functionality._

Puppet, like most tools, is it’s own reference implementation, which makes certain kinds of interoperability or tooling difficult to maintain. So this attempt to formalise the puppet language via a specification is interesting for a number of reasons.

A post from Chef all about the wider Chef open source community and how that intertwines with the company behind Chef. If you have an interest in open source governance or are using Chef definitely worth reading in full.

Netflix have released another member of the simian army, called Security Monkey. This one checks various attributes of IAM policies, S3 access policies, security groups and more, as well as tracking how they change and evolve over time. The list of future additions is also a good starting point for ideas.

A nice potted history of the Monitorama conference (although it misses out mentioning the event in Berlin). Particularly useful for lots of links to slides and other material mentioned at the last event in Portland.
