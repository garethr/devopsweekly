## Issue 192 - 7th September

_As mentioned last week, this issue is going out a little later than usual as I’m currently in Portland, Oregon. It should be back to normal time next week, but the week after I’ll be back in the US for PuppetConf. Phew_

Text as the interchange format between unix command line tools is powerful, but relies on some quite cryptic tools to use well. The next post looks briefly at an alternative, although it doesn’t mention PowerShell which does a similar thing.

A really good post on the occasional clash between database administrators and software developers, and why it doesn’t have to be that way. Good analogies with sales and marketing, and the point that communication really is everybody's responsibility,

Doing non-trivial load and performance testing of web applications is a bit of a dark art it sometimes feels like. This post does a great job of delving into how Twitter test for large spikes. A whole bunch of good lessons learned at scale.

The concept of a single source of truth for everything pertaining to your infrastructure isn’t a new idea, but Collins looks like a more modern take on the CMDB. A documented API and client libraries, along with support for physical servers, switches, racks and higher level software properties.

Portainer is an interesting combination of mesos and docker, aimed at building containers rather than running them. Worth investigating is you’re finding yourself building lots of containers and managing dedicated machines to do so.

Oh My Vagrant is an opinionated development environment suitable for docker, puppet and more development activities. Based around Vagrant, Fedora, libvert and more.

If you’ve found yourself writing small scripts in bash, and then re-implementing those same scripts for Windows as batch files then Batsh might be for you. A small scripting language that compiles to batch and bash. The online demo is pretty nifty.
