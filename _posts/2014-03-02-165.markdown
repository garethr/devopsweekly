## Issue 165 - 2nd March

_Devops weekly now has more than 10,000 subscribers. Given that when I started this newsletter 3 years ago probably only hundreds of people had even heard the word that’s pretty amazing to me. Thankyou to everyone who has written anything I’ve featured, that keeps me interested enough to keep curating this newsletter._

News

An excellent post about building a testing culture in an organisation, in this case Airbnb. Honesty about problems and lots of good advice for addressing them.

CloudFormation templates can become unwieldy quickly so the testing workflow this post suggests should be useful. It combines guard and a cloudformation validator into a new guard plugin.

The Go continuous delivery platform is going to be released as open source. It’s available free now, with the source code available shortly. Go is similar to popular continuous integration tools but with a strong focus on building pipelines. Will be interesting to see if this spurs wider adoption.

Working out ways of writing more testable code is a big part of adopting an infrastructure as code approach in my view. This post is a good example, demonstrating how to test custom facts in puppet, but the approach taken is general to anything you want to test.

A new Google+ community for people to talk about auditing in the context of organisations adopting devops practices. If you’re working in a regulated environment this might be of interest.

Sorry about the ads on this next post but it’s an interesting read. It boldly proclaims devops as being the biggest change in IT since outsourcing. It’s interesting to read opinion pieces aimed more at enterprise CIOs and viewing devops through the perspective of organisational change.

Another similar example, with a short case study of GE moving in parts away from specialists towards more full stack engineers. For people in very large organisations cases studies like this should help with convincing the boss.

Tools

Chef Metal is adding machines as resources to Chef, currently supporting Vagrant and EC2. We’ve got lots of good host level infrastructure as code tools, but very few cluster level tools that work as nicely.

Metrilyx is a web based dashboard engine for OpenTSDB, a time series database used to store large amounts of data. It allows for analyzing, cross cutting and viewing of time series data in a simple manner. The screenshots in the README give you a good idea.
