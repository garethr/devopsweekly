Good writeup from the recent devopsdays Austin, focusing on why culture is important, but just as importantly why it's hard to talk about and address. I particularly liked the observation that effective culture can be very different between different groups of people.

Interesting take on the Bay area bubble when it comes to the overlap of devops and cloud infrastructures. My experience in the UK at work and at devopsdays is similar, lots of software and infrastructure that runs real companies would be seen as legacy by your average startup.

A nice presentation (with the new Opscode branding) introducing the power of automation. It's a nice short case study of a real world problems being solved by automating hard or slow parts of a problematic process.

A great success story for Cloudfoundry solving a gnarly technical problem. What if a 50 minute outage could result in you losing half of your yearly income? Good example of playing to the strengths of Platform as a Service.
