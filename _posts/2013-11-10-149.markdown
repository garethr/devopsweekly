News

A good getting started guide for Marelle, the prolog based configuration management system. Probably mainly interesting for the discussion of logic programming and how it maps quite nicely to various automation tasks.

A light-hearted look at what a whole range of science fiction material can teach us about the importance of collaboration between developers and operations.

Nice writeup of how PagerDuty use Chef, but focusing on the people and environments rather than code. Discusses some of the tools used to support Chef, as well as approaches to testing infrastructure concerns.

The start of what looks like a useful series reviewing various dashboarding tools. The first review is for Tasseo for Graphite and features a good description of the pros and cons of using it. Hopefully more reviews soon.

The call for proposals is out for the testing and automation dev room at FOSDEM in Brussels next February. Last year was excellent and this year the organisers are looking for 30-40 minute talks and 10 minute lightning talks, to be submitted by the 30th of November.

Facebook have released Presto, a distributed SQL engine for querying huge datasets in HDFS aimed at being used for low latency queries. The post covers lots of the engineering details and the support for standard ANSI SQL is impressive.

Tools
====

Rearview is a very interesting self-service monitoring tool, allowing monitors to be easily created against data in graphite from within a nice looking web interface. Alerts can then be routed out to PagerDuty or other systems, with the monitors themselves written in-line in Ruby.

InfluxDB is an open-source, distributed, time series, events, and metrics database written in Go. It features a nice SQL-like API for querying metrics and aims to make clustering and horizontal scaling simple.

Chef Taste is a nice looking command line tool that lists out the dependencies for a Chef cookbook, along with whether they are up to date or not. A nice touch is a link to the changelog for out of date dependencies.
